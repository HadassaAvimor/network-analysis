# network-analysis

This project is a full-stack web application that visualizes graph data. The backend is implemented in Python using FastAPI, the database is SQL, and the frontend is implemented in React. The application allows users to load graph data from external APIs, visualize the data, and interact with it.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have Python, and React installed. You can then clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt

npm install

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the application by running the following command:

uvicorn main:app --reload

This will start the application on port 8000. You can then open the application in a web browser by visiting http://localhost:8000.

## Features
The project has the following features:
* Load graph data from external APIs
* Visualize the graph data using a variety of charts and graphs
* Interact with the graph data by zooming, panning, and selecting nodes and edges
* Save and load graph data



## To-Do
The following are some of the to-dos for the project:

* Add more chart and graph types
* Improve the interaction with the graph data
* Add more features to the frontend
