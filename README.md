# network-analysis

This project is a web application that combines a Python server implemented with FastAPI, an SQL database, and external APIs. The frontend is implemented with React. The system is used as a tool for communication technicians to obtain network visualization and analysis.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have Python, and React installed. You can then clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt

npm install

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the application by running the following command:

uvicorn main:app --reload

This will start the application on port 8080. You can then open the application in a web browser by visiting http://localhost:8080.

## Features
The project has the following features:
* Ability to load network capture files.
* Ability to describe the network using a graph.
* Ability to provide network analysis, such as the number of nodes, the number of links, the strength of the links between nodes, and so on.

* Add more chart and graph types
* Improve the interaction with the graph data
* Add more features to the frontend
